various clases supporting file programming in java ?

objects are divided into : 
1.inputstream :
	-file input stream
	-object input stream 
	-byte input stream 
2.outputstream:
	-file outputstream

q] what is stream ?
- objects - 1. file input stream :
		a. data input stream 
		b. buffered input stream 
	2. file output stream : 
		a. data output stream 
		b. buffered output stream 

for character string :( entire data is getting read and is converted )

objects : 1.reader - a. file reader b. buffere reader 
2. writer - a. file writer 
	b. buffer writer
