what is the differenc between fileinput stream and file reader ?
- while dealing with data we have to undrstand that whioch is the correct way of representing the data in program or system .
- if we have image file , video ,large word or excel file ,we always prefer binary .

WAP to accept customer details like 
1. customer ID
2.name 
3.age 
4. salary 
after accepting data write this data to the file delimited by ','
after writing please read customer name and customer age only and display it on VDU . 

//start 
import java.util.Scanner;
import java

public static void main(String[] args)
{
String name ;
int age ;
int salary;
int ID;

Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.Println("enter customer name , ID , age and salary respectively");
name = sc.next();
ID = sc.nextInt();
age = sc.nextInt();
salary = nextInt();

//writing to file 
FileOutputStream fo = new FileOutputStream("d:\\demo.txt");
fo.write(name.getbytes()+',');
fo.write(ID+',');
fo.write(age+',');
fo.write(salary+','+"\n");

BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(fo);

// reading  delimiting use ' , '
FileInputStream fi = new FileInputStream("d:\\demo.txt");
BufferReader br = new BufferReader(fi);


}


//sir code
import java.io.*;
import java.util.Scanner.*;
public class ExerciseEx
{
public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception
{
FileWriter fw = new FileWriter("d:\\customer.txt");

Scanner sc = new Scanner(system.in);
System.out.println("");
}
}
