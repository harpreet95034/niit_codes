Topic : java input and output programming 

q] what is exception handling in java ?what are the different ways of handling exception in java ?
how to implement them ?what happens when your program gets error ?
Ans : 
there are 3 types of error mostly occur
:
1. syntax error - error at compile time 
2. runtime error - error at runtime 
	1. exact memory for variables 
	2. program need network connection to run but it is not available 
	3.program need database but database connection could not be establish .
3. logical error - 

keywords for exceptio handlng :
	1. try
	2. catch
	3. throws

WAP accept customer details and idpay it ?without using scanner class .wlso use the concept of exception handling 
ans:
public static void main(String[] args)
{
	byte custid;
	String custname;
	int custage;
	float custsal;
	char grade ;
try
{

	InputStreamReader 	is = new 	InputStreamReader	(System.in);
BufferdReader br = new BufferedReader(is);

	System.out.println("enter student id");
custid= Byte.valueOf(br.readLine());

System.out.println("enter customer name ");
custname = br.readLine();

System.out.println("customer age ");
custage=Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());

System.out.println("customer salary");
custsal = Float.parseFloat(br.readLine());

System.out.println("customer grade ");
grade = (char)(br.read());

System.out.println("id is :"+custid);
System.out.println("name is :"+custname);
System.out.println("age is :"+custage);
System.out.println("salary is :"+custsalary);
System.out.println("grade is :"+grade);
}

catch(IOException ex)
{
	
}
}

q] what is the use of InputStreamReader and BufferedReader class ?

in ava for every type of implementation we have the support of exception handling classes ..

we have exception handling for :
1. performing arithmetic operations 
2. performing arrays
3. if we use objects 
4. if we use files , DB ,network,thread,collection,data types etc ..

"Exception" is base class for all the exception classes in java like : 

1. IOException
2.ArrayIndexoutOfBounds Exception
3.Arithmetic Exception
4. FilenotFound Exception
5. NullPointer Exception

q] what are the different types of exception in java ?what is the difference between checked and unchecked exception ?

even java supports userdefined exception ....which means as a programmer you can create your own exception class in java as per ur logic .

q]what do we mean by userdefined exception in java and how to implement user defined exception in java with eg. 

q] what is the use of try , catch , finally ,throw and throws in java 

WAP reading data from file and writing to standard output .

WAP reading data from standard input device and writing to file .

WAP to accept the customer details from keyboard and write it to file .

q] what are the different types of classes supporting 








standard input device :
	1. keyboard 
	2.file (read)
	3.DB(read)
	4. memory location 
standard output device 
	1.monitor 
	2.files(write)
	3.DB (write)
	4. memory location
